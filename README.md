# LMS (Library-Management-System)
It's a MPP(Modern Programming Practice) course project. It's focus on library management based our requirement.

I did this project with my class mates as a group. We use java technologies such javafx for UI part and java language for backend. We use eclipse IDE tools and for storing data we use notepad editor as a database. 

Contents: => demo code => class diagram => sequence diagram => usecase diagram => documentation.

Enjoy it!!!
